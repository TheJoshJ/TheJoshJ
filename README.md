## About Me

I'm a developer who took the non-traditional route into tech. After completing **Pivot Tech School** (2022) for backend development and **Hackbright Academy** (2023) for frontend, I now build internal tooling at Shipt.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about creating tools and projects for the **RuneScape community** and collaborating with **TheRSGuy**.
