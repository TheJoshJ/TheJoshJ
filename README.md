## About Me

I'm a developer who took the non-traditional route into tech. I started in Shipt's call center, then worked my way into engineering after completing Pivot Tech School (2022) for backend development and Hackbright Academy (2023) for frontend. Now I build internal tooling at Shipt.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about creating tools and projects for the **RuneScape community** and collaborating with **TheRSGuy**.
